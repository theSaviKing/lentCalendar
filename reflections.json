Then he told them many things in parables, saying: \u201cA farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop\u2014a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. Whoever has ears, let them hear.\u201d\r\nThe disciples came to him and asked, \u201cWhy do you speak to the people in parables?\u201d\r\nHe replied, \u201cBecause the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.\u201d",
